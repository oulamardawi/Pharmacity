# Pharmacity
 web application for the people who want to buy a  medicine online without the need to go to a real pharmacy. 
The main objective of our web application for the pharmacity which is a pharmacy that have two branches in Ramallah and Nablus 
is to have an easy to use, user-friendly, and simple user interface web site (i.e. for all its pages including the purchase page and the mechanism of payment as well).
The purpose of the project is for users to be always up-to-date with the new medicines in Palestine ” Recently arrived,so they will have their own account in website and
got discount with every time they buy through the website 
 
 They can upload their perceptions one or more, also members will buy the medicine online.
 In addition to customers, there are also administrator who log in and would be able to do certain tasks,
 for example, they’d be able to view all customers and their information and add medicines to the website , update the data,
 he will be able to view all the uploaded perceptions from the customers and delete or check the chosen ones, 
 they’d be able to add and delete the customer if he isn’t real or robot, he can edit the “Recently arrived” and “contact information 
 
We have actually been reading about the specific pharmacies and how it deal with customers ,
so they can’t manage a huge number of customers, or delay their orders  to other days which is not good for patient ,
especially that pharmacity have a specific medicine for specific patient that are not sold in any pharmacy , 
Then, we have decided to create our own pharmacy that will do all of these services globally, because 
it’s needed and there’s actually no other pharmacy in the Palestinian  market that provide the same kind of service online, so this pharmacy would be one of 
a kind in that market.
